Task 1:

Conclusion: The optimization model successfully maximized production within the given resource constraints, highlighting the practical application of linear programming in industrial settings. Future research could explore more complex models, incorporating additional constraints and objectives to further enhance production efficiency.

Task 2:

Conslusions:

Conclusion: The Monte Carlo method provided a precise approximation of the integral, closely matching the result from the SciPy quad function. This exercise underscores the practicality of Monte Carlo simulations in numerical integration, especially when dealing with complex functions. Future work could explore other functions and integration bounds to further validate the method's accuracy and efficiency.
